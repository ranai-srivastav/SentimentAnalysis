# SentimentAnalysis

I will train a Machine Learning algorithm that will 
1. Break up a text into relevant words and will remove unnecessary words that offer little for an emotional analysis
2. 

I will use the Twitter API to collect tweets according to given parameters such as hashtags or responses and replies to controversial tweets. I can only query using Hashtags with the academic API access. 


My research will involve taking a group of tweets and analyzing them to figure out if the tweet is happy, sad, or angry. I will do so by training a Machine Learning algorithm that will be trained using tweets and then classify things according to the given criteria.
